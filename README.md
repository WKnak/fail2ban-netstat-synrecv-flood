# Fail2Ban NetStat SYN_RECV Flood

Some tools, scripts and filters for Fail2Ban to generate log of SYN_RECV Flood attacks.

Combined with the another project, a Python script Fail2Ban Block IP Range (fail2ban-block-ip-range), link below, the resulting LOG with the IPs can be combined and filtered by CIDR, so future attacks can be avoided
